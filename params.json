{"name":"Geopapurls","tagline":"OGC WMS to Geopaparazzi mapurls generator","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nAfter having seen all the problems that the creation of a mapurl for WMS services was causing, we decided to create a small service, that would automatically generate mapurls for [Geopaparazzi](http://www.geopaparazzi.eu) for known WMS services.\r\n\r\n## The client in geopaparazzi\r\n\r\nFor geopaparazzi users everything is transparent, the import view has an entry named: MAPURL\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/tanto/geopapurls/img/04_mapurls.png)\r\n\r\nOnce you enter that menu, you find the services query view:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/tanto/geopapurls/img/05_mapurls.png)\r\n\r\nHere you can define some filter parameters and start the query. \r\n\r\nIn the following example case the gps was placed in Italy, so the query returned:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/tanto/geopapurls/img/06_mapurls.png)\r\n\r\nOne can then simply download the service, which will install the mapurl inside the system. \r\nThe user is prompted for a custom name to name the service after, else the original name will be used. Since the original name could be duplicated in different services, the prefix \"tanto_\" will be added in that case.\r\n\r\n## Suggest a service\r\n\r\nWant to see an open WMS service appearing inside Geopaparazzi? You can suggest us a service to be added. We will be happy to add it. Please use the [\"Suggest a new WMS\" page](http://mapurls.geopaparazzi.eu/suggest) to do so.\r\n\r\n## Problems?\r\n\r\nIf you experience problems with this service, [please open an issue in the tracker](https://github.com/tanto/geopapurls/issues).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
